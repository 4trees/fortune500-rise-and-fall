<!--         <h1 class="text-center">The Rise and Fall of the Greater China's Economy</h1>
        <h3 class="text-center">Based on The Perspective of View of Enterprise Ranking</h3>
        <p class="text-center intro">China's economy has grown rapidly after the reform and opening-up, however, Hong Kong and Taiwan's economic performance in recent years gradually slows down and declines. Fortune 500 is generally considered as a mirror of the economy. Here, we want to use the data visualization to test this hypothesis: enterprise ranking can reflect economic growth. The data are based on the past two decades from Fortune 500.</p>

Taiwan's downturn in the economy can also be observed from the ups and downs of the enterprises' rankings. As for Hong Kong's economic boom in recent years, we cannot observe this phenomenon from the fortune 500 visualizations.</P>
